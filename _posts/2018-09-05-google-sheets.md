<i>Google Spreadsheets is a Web-based application that allows users to create, update and modify spreadsheets and share the data live online. The Ajax-based program is compatible with Microsoft Excel and CSV (comma-separated values) files. Spreadsheets can also be saved as HTML.</i>

<b> This is my </b><i>first </i>blog in which I experiment.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Greeter</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">message</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">message</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">john</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Greeter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello, World&#39;</span>

<span class="n">john</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">greet</span>
</pre></div>

We also started using Google Sheets to make a Caesar Cipher, but I don't feel enough happened to write a blog about it.
